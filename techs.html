                                <p> 
                                    Majority of farmers in the country practise subsistence farming.
                                      It is characterised by small and scattered land holdings and use of primitive tools.
                                      As the farmers are poor, they do not use fertilisers and high yielding variety of seeds in their fields to the extent they should do.
                                     Facilities like electricity and irrigation are generally not available to them.

                                <p>In this type of agriculture, first of all a piece of forest land is cleared by felling trees and burning of trunks and branches.
                                    >After the land is cleared, crops are grown for two to three years and then the land is abandoned as the fertility of the soil decreases.
                                    The farmers then move to new areas and the process is repeated.
                                    Dry paddy, maize, millets and vegetables are the crops commonly grown in this type of farming.

                                <p>Plantation farming is bush or tree farming. It was introduced by the British in the 19th century.
                                    It is a single crop farming of rubber, tea, coffee, cocoa, spices, coconut and fruit crops like apples, grapes, oranges, etc.
                                    It is capital intensive and demands good managerial ability, technical know-how, sophisticated machinery, fertilisers, irrigation, and transport facilities.
                                    Plantation agriculture is an export-oriented agriculture.

                                <p> Dry farming or dry-land farming may be defined as a practice of growing crops without irrigation in areas which receive an annual rainfall of 750 mm â€“ 500 mm or even less.

                                <p>The hill and mountain slopes are cut to form terraces and the land is used in the same way as in permanent agriculture.
                                    Since the availability of flat land is limited terraces are made to provide small patch of level land.
                                    Soil erosion is also checked due to terrace formation on hill slopes.
